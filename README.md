# Garry Monk Bot - Version 2.0

Welcome to the repo for Garry Monk's Twitter partner, @garrymonkbot. The twitter has been created as a joke, and is not in affiliation with Garry Monk, nor Middlesbrough Football Club. 

The code in the repo was created by Josh Cawthorne, as a fun side-project. 

# Why Version 2?

In relation with the development of monkorbot.com, I discovered that the code powering Version 1, was good enough to pass on Twitter as 'a funny bot', but wasn't yet good enough to make the game of choosing between the real Garry Monk's tweets, and those of the bots. Therefore, I set-out to re-work the bot from the ground up. One function of version 2's bot is already longer and more complex than the entireity of Version 1.

# What are you using to build it?

Most of the bot is vanilla Javascript, though I'm using Node.js and Heroku to power the bot's ability to Tweet randomly, with no prior interaction from a user. This code is currently not available on the repo.

# What functionality is missing?

- Tweets based on a win, draw or loss. (In Progress)
- Tweets based on training.
- Tweets based on new signings, or other developments within Monk's career.
