# Garry Monk Bot - Version 2.0

Welcome to the repo for Garry Monk's Twitter partner, @garrymonkbot. The bot, and accompanying twitter account, have been created as a joke, and are not affiliated with Garry Monk, nor Middlesbrough Football Club. 

The code in the repo was created by Josh Cawthorne, as a fun side-project. 

# Why Version 2?

In relation with the development of monkorbot.com, I discovered that the code powering Version 1, was good enough to pass on Twitter as 'a funny bot', but wasn't yet good enough to make the game of choosing between the real Garry Monk's tweets, and those of the bots a challenge. Therefore, I set-out to re-work the bot from the ground up. One function of version 2's bot is already longer and more complex than the entireity of Version 1.

An example of the power of Version 2 when compared to Version 1:

A typical Version 1 Tweet:

  *"I don't feel that we deserved to lose today. On to the next game. #UTB"*
  
A typical version 2 Tweet:

  *"We're travelling to Birmingham, for our game against Villa. Every game in this league is ultra competitive, and as ever, our great support will be key. #UTB"*

# What are you using to build it?

Most of the bot is vanilla Javascript, though I'm using Node.js and Heroku to power the bot's ability to Tweet randomly, with no prior interaction from a user. This code is currently not available on the repo.

# What functionality is missing?

- Tweets based on a win, draw or loss. (In Progress)
- Tweets based on training.
- Tweets based on new signings, or other developments within Monk's career.

# Can I play with it?

Sure! To view the tweet's it generates, visit https://twitter.com/garrymonkbot. (Please note, version 2 is not live on Twitter yet!)

Alternatively, visit the emulator at https://joshcawthorne.github.io/Garry-Monk-Bot-Version-2/ to generate your own tweets.

# Are you THE Garry Monk?

If so, please don't sue me, it's only a joke. Also, look into getting yourself a new Social Media manager. I'm available for hire. I could even code you a sick bot to do it for you.
